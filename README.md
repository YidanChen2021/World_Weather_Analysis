# World_Weather_Analysis  
## Overview
The PlanMyTrip app is a smart app that helps users design their trip based on weather information. This current project was brought out to add a feature for users to set their weather preference and have the app identify potential travel destinations, nearby hotels and travel itinerary.  
## Project outline  
This project was brought out in 3 steps.
- Step 1: Retrieve weather data from OpenWeatherMap for a set of 2000 random latitudes and Longitudes.
- Step 2: Create a customer travel destinations map based on their weather preferences, and identify nearby hotels. Use g_key to pull out a marker layer map with detailed weather information for each city.
- Step 3: Use the Google Directions API to play a trip between 4 cities for customers. 
## Summary
Using API key can help run analysis based on real time data, and reduce the time of generating data manually.
